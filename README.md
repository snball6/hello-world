Learning how to use GitHub

Hello,

My name is Sarah. I'm currently taking classes to earn a second Bachelor's in 
Computer Science. I'd like to supplement my course load with my own projects
and I'm hoping learning how to use GitHub will help.

I like books (favorites are Beowulf and Persuasion), writing (aspiring novelist),
drawing (particularly web comics), cooking, code (I'm a newbie, but working on it), 
spreadsheets, and cats (I have three. Named Fafnir, Grendel, and Caliban).
